# missing-semester-nlp# The Missing Semester of Your NLP Education

Welcome to the official repository for **The Missing Semester of Your NLP Education**, an advanced practical course designed for MSc students to bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world NLP practice. Inspired by MIT's "The Missing Semester of Your CS Education."

## 📘 Course Overview
This course introduces essential but often neglected aspects of NLP workflows including multilingual and low-resource language processing, prompt engineering, ethical data curation, reproducibility, and effective tooling.
